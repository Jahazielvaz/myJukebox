# myJukebox

DESCRIPTION: This is my fun little Jukebox project. This Jukebox works similar to pandora. It's going to have your typical play, rewind, ff, randomize, and playlist buttons. I'm currently going to be uploading the songs to it, but at it gets more complex, It's going to have a button that lets people upload songs to the playlist, and a button that allows people to create a station, and it's going to pull songs from the cloud.
